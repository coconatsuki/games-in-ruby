Tic Tac Toe &amp; Mastermind  &amp; Hangman  &amp; Connect Four (in test driven development)

All of these games where built while studying the 'Ruby Programming Chapter'
 on the Odin Project online bootcamp (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming).
There were meant to practice the theory of each part of the Chapter.

The Tic Tac Toe game :

It allowed me to learn more about 'Object Oriented Programming' and practice effectively.
For example, I had to be careful not to share information between classes any more than I had to.
It also helped me to get a better understanding of scopes.
I also had to add some tests afterward. (not in TDD)

The mastermind game :

This was one more chance to practice OOP even more.
The interesting part here is that it's possible to reverse the roles :
The user can either be the creator of the secret code or the guesser.
Also, it was fun to experiment a bit of AI in trying to make the computer smarter
(for example, if it guessed the right color but the wrong position,
  its next guess would include that color somewhere.)

The Hangman game :

This one made me practice the interaction with files and serialization.
A dictionnary file has to be read to generate a word, and the game offers the possibility of being saved and loaded.

The Connect Four game :

This was my first time to experiment strict TDD with Rspec.
